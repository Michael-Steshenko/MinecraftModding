# MinecraftModding
This is repo is, at least for now, for personal use, I will be documanting stuff that I find useful for minecraft modding.
I am using Forge version: TODO: add
Minecraft version: TODO: add

## Forge setup tutorial and example mod 
I found this tutorial for initial setup: https://thebookofmodding.ml/setting-up-the-environment/
Only thing I see missing is:
in the turotrial in the step ( Select "run client" task in intellij ) , you get an error: module not specified, select the main module under "use classpath of module".

## Starting to make mods
currently following this tutorial for learning the basics: https://championash5357.github.io/ChampionAsh5357/tutorial/minecraft/1.16.1/items/armor
